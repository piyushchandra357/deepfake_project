# Description

Deepfakes are synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. They are deceiving and with the use of a good algorithm, a deepfake video becomes harder to differ from actual recorded footage or clicked images. The main machine learning methods used to create deepfakes are based on deep learning and involve training generative neural network architectures, such as autoencoders or generative adversarial networks (GANs).

## Dataset
[This]() directory consists some of the examples of deepfakes created using Deep Learning methods like GANs, CNNs, etc. 


The Dataset Consists of the dataset of [DeepFake Detection Challenge on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data)
The data used in the notebook is just the files in train_sample_videos.zip and test_videos.zip respectively.
